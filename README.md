MotionBook is an open source based project. Because of that, I decided to open MotionBook source.

### Add Github Personal access token and user Id in `Key.swift`

```Swift 
enum Key: String {
    case gitHubId = "younatics"
    case githubToken = ""
    case firbaseKey = ""
}
```

## Basic Logic

#### 1. Get data from MotionBook README.md
Get basic data and store in `RealmSwift`

#### 2. Update latest data from GitHub Api
Once a week, MotionBook will check date and update Github data(Stars, Issues, Forks) using GitHub Api.

#### 3. Use On-Demand Resources for faster download speed
[On-Demand Resources](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/On_Demand_Resources_Guide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015083-CH2-SW1) make faster download speed. 

#### 4. Update Gif data to Realm
Update Gif data to `Realm` and store.
